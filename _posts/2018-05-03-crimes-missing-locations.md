We have discovered that most records in the [Crimes - 2001 to present](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ijzp-q8t2) and [Crimes - One year prior to present](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/x2n5-8w5q) datasets on or after 12/24/2017 have blank values for:

* X Coordinate
* Y Coordinate
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Location

We are investigating the problem and will update this post with any significant updates.

**Update 5/7/2018, 10:15 am:** The problem has been fixed and records, including those previously affected, are showing locations again.
