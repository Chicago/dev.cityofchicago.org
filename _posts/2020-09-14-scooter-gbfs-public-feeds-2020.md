As part of the 2020 E-scooter pilot, we have updated our links to real-time locations of scooters available for rent in Chicago.
 
The data are accessible by API, and each of the three scooter companies hosts its own API feed as a requirement of participation. Details on the data specification can be found [here](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs). Updated URLs for GBFS feeds should be available soon on [GitHub](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) and are also listed below.

| Name | GBFS Feed URL |

| Bird Chicago | [https://mds.bird.co/gbfs/chicago/gbfs.json](https://mds.bird.co/gbfs/chicago/gbfs.json) |
| Lime Chicago | [https://data.lime.bike/api/partners/v1/gbfs/chicago/gbfs.json](https://data.lime.bike/api/partners/v1/gbfs/chicago/gbfs.json) |
