<p>Many of the automated jobs we use to update datasets were taking much longer than usual to run or not completing at all today, although we did not discover the problem until this evening.</p><p>Because all of last night&rsquo;s overnight jobs completed successfully as far as we know, most datasets should be up-to-date and we think tonight&rsquo;s overnight jobs should complete, although possibly not by their normal times.  Because it is a weekend and Monday is a City of Chicago holiday (Pulaski Day), most source systems should have little change until Tuesday (appearing on the portal early Wednesday, in most cases), anyway. </p><p>We have temporarily reduced the frequency of our every-15-minute updates (<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ygr5-vcbg">Towed Vehicles</a>, <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/5k2z-suxx">Relocated Vehicles</a>, <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd">Traffic Congestion by Region</a>, and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf">Traffic Congestion by Segment</a>) to once an hour and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/97wa-y6ff">Public Chauffeurs</a> from once an hour through most of the day to once a day at 11:30 pm.</p><p>We are working with our Data Portal vendor and will post any significant updates, either as modifications to this post or new posts.</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience.  If any of the schedule changes would create problems for your processes, please contact @ChicagoCDO and/or @JonOpenData on Twitter and we may be able to make adjustments to meet your needs.</p><p><b>Update 3/3/2015, 2:50 pm - </b>We restored all updates to their normal frequencies about three hours ago.  A few of the jobs since that time have not succeeded but, for the most part, we appear to be back to normal operations.  We are continuing to monitor but there will be no further updates to this post unless significant problems recur.</p>
