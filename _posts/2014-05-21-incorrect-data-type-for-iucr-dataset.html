<p>The column containing IUCR codes on the IUCR lookup table was incorrectly categorized as a numeric value instead of plain text. As a result, while the data appeared on the portal correctly, someone attempting to download it would have seen 22 null values in the IUCR column.</p>
<p>We have correct the issue by changed the data type to &ldquo;plain text&rdquo;. We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
