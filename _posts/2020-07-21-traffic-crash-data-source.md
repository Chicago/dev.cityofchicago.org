We have made a small internal adjustment to the data source for our Traffic Crash datasets:

* [Traffic Crashes - Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85ca-t3if)
* [Traffic Crashes - Vehicles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/68nd-jvt3)
* [Traffic Crashes - People](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/u6pd-qa9d)

The data are fundamentally the same but come from a slightly different version of the source dataset. This change added about 0.6% to the historical count of crashes and should be more reliable on an ongoing basis.

Please feel free to contact us at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions.
