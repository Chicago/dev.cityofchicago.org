As of May 7, 2021 we will no longer update the [COVID-19 Daily Testing – By Person](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t4hh-4ku9) dataset. All data currently in the dataset will remain, but new data will not be added. 

This change is being made based on advice from the [Chicago Department of Public Health](https://www.chicago.gov/cdph) in keeping with current best practices.
 
Early in the pandemic, monitoring the number of tests an individual received was a useful way of tracking percent positivity. However, more than a year later, as  more people have received multiple tests, it has become a less useful way to monitor the current situation and is no longer used in the Department of Public Health’s own operations. Please see the dataset [COVID-19 Daily Testing – By Test](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Testing-By-Test/gkdw-2tgv), which will continue to be updated, for testing data used to calculate percent positivity. 

As always, please feel free to contact us at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions, comments, or concerns related to the datasets. For subject matter questions about these datasets or any other COVID-19 datasets, please contact the Department of Public Health's epidemiology team at [epidatarequests@cityofchicago.org](mailto:epidatarequests@cityofchicago.org).
