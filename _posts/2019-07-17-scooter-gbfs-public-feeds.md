We have made available a new source of open data, which delivers real-time locations of scooters available for rent in Chicago. More information on Chicago’s scooter pilot is available at [chicago.gov/scooters](https://chicago.gov/scooters). 
 
The data are accessible by API, and each of the 10 scooter companies hosts its own API feed as a requirement of participation. Details on the data specification can be found [here](https://github.com/dsgermain/gbfs/tree/f76251ad4c754b62defc42562887724f287b73ea). Updated URLs for GBFS feeds are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) and are also listed below.
