The following datasets were not updated yesterday (2/5/2019) or today. We have identified the common point of failure and are working to fix it. There is no current estimate. We will edit this post with any significant updates.

* [Building Violations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/22u3-xenr)
* [Business Licenses](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/r5kz-chrr)
* [House Share Prohibited Buildings List](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/7bzs-jsyj)
* [Ordinance Violations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/6br9-quuz)
* [Public Health Department Events](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/38sz-xyf4)
* [Red Light Camera Violations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/spqx-js37)
* [Sidewalk Cafe Permits](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/nxj5-ix6z)
* [Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projects](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/mex4-ppfc)
* [Traffic Crashes - Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85ca-t3if) (The two related datasets are updating.)
* [Transportation Department Permits](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/pubx-yq2d)
* [West Nile Virus (WNV) Mosquito Test Results](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/jqe8-8r6s) (There is no testing done at this time of year so no updates would be expected, even without this issue.)

**Update 2/7/2019, 12:00 pm:** We believe the problem is solved. Some datasets have already updated correctly. Others are currently processing and should appear on the Data Portal throughout the day today.
