The building permits dataset has not successfully updated since May 14. This is an automated dataset and has not succeeded due to an importing error. Our team is looking at the issue, but there is not an ETA, yet.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

## Update 5/22/2014
We are still experiencing the issue, but have started to perform manual uploads for this data. Thus, it may not occur at the same frequency or time each day. Will keep you posted.

## Update 6/2/2014
A fix was implemented last week and has been successful for several days. We have closed the issue.
