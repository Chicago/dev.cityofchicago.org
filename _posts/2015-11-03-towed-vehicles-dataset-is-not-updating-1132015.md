The Towed Vehicles dataset, which normally updates every 15 minutes, has not updated since 9:46 am today. We think we have found the root cause and that the dataset will start updating again at about 6 pm.This problem will affect services that depend on the dataset or the data source that feeds it.  These services include http://webapps1.cityofchicago.org/vehicleSearch and http://www.wasmycartowed.com.Update 11/4/2015 - The dataset is updating normally again.
