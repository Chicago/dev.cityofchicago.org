As of 4/21/2021, an update will be made to add two additional race/ethnicity breakdowns to the dataset [COVID-19 Daily Vaccinations – Chicago Residents](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/2vhs-cf6b).

* Native American/Alaskan Native Non-Latinx
* Pacific Islander/Hawaiian Native Non-Latinx

These race/ethnicity groups are currently included in totals for `Other Race Non-Latinx`. By providing more race/ethnicity categories, the [Chicago Department of Public Health](https://www.chicago.gov/cdph) hopes that programming can be more appropriately targeted to various groups. 

This change will add six columns to the dataset – two additional categories each for:

* Total Doses
* 1st Dose
* Vaccine Series Completed 

This update will be applied historically and past dates will be filled in with these new data. Totals for `Other Race Non-Latinx` will decrease as `Native American/Alaskan Native Non-Latinx` and `Pacific Islander/Hawaiian Native Non-Latinx` will be presented separately in the new columns described above.
Since existing column names will not change, dataset uses that refer to columns by name should not break, although generally will require incorporating the new columns to get all the desired data. Uses that rely on column position (a risky approach for this reason) might require changes to continue to work at all since the new columns will be added in the midst of existing columns.
