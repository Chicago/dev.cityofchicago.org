Our Employee Indebtedness to the City of Chicago [dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/pasx-mnuv) was not updating properly from 12/15/2018 through 3/2/2019. The update job runs weekly on Saturdays. We discovered the problem today and believe it is fixed for future runs.

There is no way to fill in the missing rows, so there will be a permanent gap in the data. We performed a special run today so there are records dated 3/5/2019, even though it is a Tuesday and therefore somewhat out of sync with most of the dataset.
