Due to an upcoming change in the source system, we will be removing two columns from the [Sidewalk Cafe Permits](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/nxj5-ix6z) dataset:

*  `PRECINCT`
*  `WARD PRECINCT` (a combination of the Ward and Precinct values)

The exact timing is still being determined but will be no sooner than 3/19/2021. In order to ease the transition, these columns will initially remain but will be blank for all records. No sooner than one month after this occurs, we will remove the columns completely.

To be clear, the `WARD` column will remain and continue to be populated.

As always, please contact the City of Chicago Open Data Team at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions.
