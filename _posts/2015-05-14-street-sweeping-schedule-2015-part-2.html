<p>

We have posted our <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ggci-kynu">street sweeping schedule</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/2cgx-fb86">map</a>, for sweeping and associated parking restrictions from May 18 through the end of street sweeping season in November.

</p><p>As discussed in an <a href="http://chicagoportalstatus.tumblr.com/post/114757488330/street-sweeping-schedule-2015">earlier post</a>, Chicago’s new ward map will go into effect on May 18, affecting a range of City operations, including street sweeping.  We previously posted the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/waad-z968">street sweeping schedule</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/4qtf-5nmn">map</a> for April and the first half of May, based on the older ward map (the current one at the time of this posting).</p><p>We have also made a revision to the earlier schedule dataset.  Some records had blank dates, indicating that the area was not scheduled to be swept in that month. We have deleted those records, making it consistent with previous years and the newly posted May 18 - November dataset.</p><p><b>Update 5/14/2015, 4:35 pm -</b> We have discovered a few errors and will be posting an updated schedule tomorrow.  We still believe the map to be accurate.</p><p><b>Update 5/15/2015, 5:20 pm -</b> We have posted the updated schedule. It turns out there were some corrections to the map, after all, so we have also updated that dataset.</p>
