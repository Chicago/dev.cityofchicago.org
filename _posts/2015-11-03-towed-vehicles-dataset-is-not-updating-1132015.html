<p>The <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ygr5-vcbg">Towed Vehicles</a> dataset, which normally updates every 15 minutes, has not updated since 9:46 am today. We think we have found the root cause and that the dataset will start updating again at about 6 pm.</p><p>This problem will affect services that depend on the dataset or the data source that feeds it.  These services include <a href="http://webapps1.cityofchicago.org/vehicleSearch/">http://webapps1.cityofchicago.org/vehicleSearch</a> and <a href="http://www.wasmycartowed.com/">http://www.wasmycartowed.com</a>.</p><p><b>Update 11/4/2015 - The dataset is updating normally again.</b></p>
