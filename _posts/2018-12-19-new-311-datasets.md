The City of Chicago launched its new [311](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/sites/311ProjectInformation/home.html) system on 12/18/2018. Among the benefits we are able to offer is increased open data about these requests.

The first new dataset in this effort is [311 Service Requests](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v6vf-nfxy). Unlike our previous approach of splitting each type of request into a separate dataset and publishing only 12 request types, this dataset includes all published types (91 currently, with plans to expand over time) in one dataset. As with any tabular dataset, you can create and save [filtered views](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/202950808-Creating-a-Filtered-View) that show only certain request types or filter in any other way you like. This dataset also shows far more information about each service request than the previous datasets.

For the initial launch, we are not yet showing the answers to type-specific questions ("flex questions"). These are the follow up questions that you would be asked when opening a service request that help clarify the work to be done. We want to show these questions and answers but there are some technical complexities and we wanted to take the time to do it well. There will be a number of enhancements to the 311 open data and we expect this to be one of them. Please see our [311 Public Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/AODvHk2V/311-public-roadmap) for more information on this topic, as well as other potential enhancements to the new 311 system.

As a [reminder](http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2018/12/11/legacy-sr-datasets-announcement.html), our 12 previously existing 311 datasets will remain live for historical use but will not continue to update. Because some requests were migrated from the old 311 system to the new one, they will appear in both the relevant old dataset and the new one. These records can be identified in the new dataset by the `LEGACY_RECORD` column.

The 12 old 311 Service Requests datasets will no longer be updated, although will remain for historical use.

Please contact the City of Chicago Open Data Team at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions related to the 311 datasets. However, please direct any questions or comments about the 311 system, itself, to [CHIdeas](https://www.chideas.org) or the [311 Public Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/AODvHk2V/311-public-roadmap).

This post will be updated as the presentation of 311 open data evolves, with any significant updates annouced through the [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) account.
