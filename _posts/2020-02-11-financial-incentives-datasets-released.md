We are happy to announce that the City of Chicago has released a number of new datasets related to Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts and other forms of financial incentives to catalyze economic development. We have also made some changes to existing datasets.
 
**New Datasets**
 
Seven new datasets show individual Financial Incentive Projects – two relating to TIFs and five relating to other types of incentives. They are:
 
* [Financial Incentive Projects - Neighborhood Opportunity Fund (NOF) Large](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Financial-Incentive-Projects-Neighborhood-Opportun/j7ew-b73u)
* [Financial Incentive Projects - Neighborhood Opportunity Fund (NOF) Small](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Financial-Incentive-Projects-Neighborhood-Opportun/rym7-49n8)
* [Financial Incentive Projects - Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Financial-Incentive-Projects-Property-Assessed-Cle/cnna-nmxx)
* [Financial Incentive Projects - Property Tax Abatement](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Financial-Incentive-Projects-Property-Tax-Abatemen/syk7-tkvr)
* [Financial Incentive Projects - Small Business Improvement Fund (SBIF)
Community & Economic Development](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Financial-Incentive-Projects-Small-Business-Improv/etqr-sz5x)
* [Financial Incentive Projects - (TIF-Funded) Economic Development](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Financial-Incentive-Projects-TIF-Funded-Economic-D/iekz-rtng)
* [Financial Incentive Projects - TIF Works](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Financial-Incentive-Projects-TIF-Works/v7gx-e2v6)
 
An eighth new dataset shows [Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Investment Committee Decisions](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/nm3d-wkdd).
 
All eight datasets will initially be updated quarterly and we hope to be able to increase the frequency as enhancements to the source data systems permit.
 
While not directly part of this data release, we encourage those interested in TIFs to explore the [Department of Planning and Development’s](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/provdrs/tif.html) separate [TIF portal](https://webapps1.chicago.gov/ChicagoTif/).
 
 
**Changes to Existing Datasets**
 
The already-existing Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projects dataset has been changed in the following ways:
 
* It has been renamed to [Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Funded RDA and IGA Projects](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/mex4-ppfc) in order to better represent the content. Existing links should continue to work for all purposes. Please let us know if you find this not to be the case.

* In November 2019, we [announced](http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2019/11/25/tif-project-changes.html) some changes made at that time and two additional changes to be made later:
    * **Remove the PROJECT ID column** – We have now done that.
    * **Convert the LOCATION column from the classic Location type to the newly available Point type to allow for additional functionality** – We have decided not to make this change, after all, at least for the foreseeable future. As we investigated what would be involved, we came to realize that the migration path was not as straightforward – either for us or for people using the data – as expected. Therefore, both for this dataset and for others, we likely will keep existing Location columns. Our practice in recent months has been and will continue to be using the Point column type for new datasets. If we eventually have a better way to make this change, ideally with good backwards compatibility, we may do that for this dataset and others. We would announce such a change here or in a similar forum.
 
The data in the [Small Business Improvement Fund (SBIF) Grant Agreements](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/jp7n-tgmf) dataset is also present, along with additional data in the new [Financial Incentive Projects - Small Business Improvement Fund (SBIF)](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/etqr-sz5x) dataset. Therefore, we will be removing the Small Business Improvement Fund (SBIF) Grant Agreements dataset. **Please make any necessary updates to your uses of this dataset.** We will not remove it any sooner than 2/24/2020.
