<p>We have suspended updates of the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/97wa-y6ff">Public Chauffeurs</a> dataset due to an issue with the source system. Â We hope to be able to restart them later today. The current version of the dataset likely includes few updates to chauffeur records made today.</p><p>We will modify this post with any significant updates to the situation.</p><p><b>Update 12/7/2015, 4:30 pm - We will not be able to restart the updates today. We plan to do at least a one-time update from a secondary data source tomorrow morning and hope to resume hourly, business-hour updates later in the day.</b></p><p><b>Update 12/8/2015, 11:30 am - Did the one-time update from the secondary source last updated at midnight last night.</b></p><p><b>Update 12/9/2015, 11:45 am - The source system issue is taking longer to resolve than expected. We, again, d<b>id a one-time update from the secondary source last updated at midnight last night and will continue to do so daily, if necessary. We will update this post when we have returned to normal updates.</b></b></p><p><b><b>Update 12/11/2015, 5:00 pm - We have returned to normal updates of this dataset.</b></b></p>
