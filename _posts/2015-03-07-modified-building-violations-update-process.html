<p>We have upgraded the mechanism that updates the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/22u3-xenr">Building Violations</a> dataset every day.  The main visible effect of this change is that the record counts for 2013-2015 have increased by about 80 percent.  We found some modifications and new building violations were not updating or being correctly added on the portal but are now doing a complete re-query of the source database and complete replace of the dataset each time we update.</p><p>The last version of the dataset before the change in update mechanism is visible at <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/f4ic-vjbw">https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/f4ic-vjbw</a>.  This link may expire at some point so if you need the records, we recommend extracting and saving them.<br/></p>
