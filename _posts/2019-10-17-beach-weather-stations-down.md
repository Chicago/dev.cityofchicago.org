Due to a Chicago Park District hardware upgrade project, the sensors that feed the [Beach Weather Stations - Automated Sensors](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75) dataset have been offline since 9/30/2019. The project is anticipated to be completed before the end of 2019 and the dataset should start receiving new rows at that time.

As always, feel free to ask any questions about the dataset or the Data Portal at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO). However, please direct any questions about the weather stations, themselves, to the Chicago Park District at (312) 742-3224.

**Update, 10/2/2020:** The project is complete and new rows are being added again.
