<p>We are having problems with updates to a number of datasets.  You can confirm the last modification date of any dataset by clicking the About button in the upper right of the page.  The datasets that update multiple times per day do not appear to be affected so exact time of the last update is not relevant in this case.</p><p>We will update this post with any significant changes to the situation.</p><p><b>Update 6/2/2015, 10:10 am - </b>The updates are generally working again. A notable exception is <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/4ijn-s7e5">Food Inspections</a>, which currently shows no inspections after Thursday, 5/28/2015. We are looking into the problem.</p>
