We have added a new dataset related to COVID-19 testing and renamed an existing one.

The existing dataset, previously named "COVID-19 Daily Testing" is now [COVID-19 Daily Testing - By Person](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t4hh-4ku9). Existing links should continue to work.

The new dataset is [COVID-19 Daily Testing - By Test](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/gkdw-2tgv).

The "By Person" dataset includes each person only once -- on the earliest date he/she received a positive result, if ever, and otherwise the earliest date he/she received a not positive result.

Because it is based on the "By Person" dataset, the weekly [COVID-19 Cases, Tests, and Deaths by ZIP Code](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/yhhz-zm2v) dataset similarly includes a distinct person only once, according to the same rule.

**(Note, 7/22/2020 4 pm: The previous two paragraphs have been corrected from the original version of this post.)**

The "By Test" dataset shows distinct tests performed. All tests known to the [Chicago Department of Public Health](https://www.chicago.gov/cdph) should be included *except* multiple tests for a person on the same day with the same result. The positivity rate displayed in this dataset uses the method most commonly used by other jurisdictions in the United States.
