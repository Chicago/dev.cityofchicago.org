We have added a new dataset related to COVID-19 testing and renamed an existing one.

The existing dataset, previously named "COVID-19 Daily Testing" is now [COVID-19 Daily Testing - By Person](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t4hh-4ku9). Existing links should continue to work.

The new dataset is [COVID-19 Daily Testing - By Test](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/gkdw-2tgv).
