So, you’ve come to rely on the open data portal to power a website, a research project, or simply browse. First, thank you! We do want to make the open data portal an effective platform for everyone.

The portal has grown quickly in three years to almost 600 datasets. As developers have come to rely on the portal, the open data team is looking forward to improving that experience. Thus, we’ve launched the status blog to keep you in the loop about changes and issues with the data portal.

The portal is a sophisticated setup of automated scripts that refresh data on a daily, weekly, or monthly process. But, sometimes things go wrong. If something does malfunction, it’s important that we provide a basic service of keeping our users up-to-date on the resolution.

What kind of things will we write about here?

We are working to migrate geographic datasets from attachments to browse-able maps
Change the API call name to correct a spelling error or improve consistency.
Provide an update if we have a technical issue or out-of-date dataset.
This blog will be updated if we notice an issue or if one is brought to our attention. Visit here to see if there are any known issues and keep abreast of developments.

Each post will be marked with the dataset’s 4x4, which is a unique identifier associated with each dataset. You can find the 4x4, such as usfg-z9mx, can be found in the URL.
