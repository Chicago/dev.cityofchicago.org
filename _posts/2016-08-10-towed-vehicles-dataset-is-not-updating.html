<p>The Towed Vehicles <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ygr5-vcbg">dataset</a>, which normally updates every 15 minutes, has not updated since 10:01 am today.  We are investigating the cause and will post any significant changes &ndash; including when the updates resume &ndash; as edits to this post.</p><p>Services making use of this dataset, such as <a href="http://www.wasmycartowed.com/">http://www.wasmycartowed.com</a>, will also be affected.  We are not certain but initial indications are that the City of Chicago’s <a href="https://webapps1.cityofchicago.org/vehicleSearch/org/cityofchicago/vs/controller/search/start.do">Find Your Vehicle</a> page also has not been updating for towed vehicles since approximately the same time.</p><p>Please note that the Relocated Vehicles <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/5k2z-suxx/data">dataset </a>updates separately and appears to be working properly.</p><p><b>Update 8/10/2016, 12:43 pm - The dataset appears to be updating properly again.  We will continue to monitor but this will be the last update unless the problem returns.</b></p>
