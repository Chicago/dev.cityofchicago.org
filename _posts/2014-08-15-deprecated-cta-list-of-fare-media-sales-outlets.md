We have deprecated the CTA - List of Fare Media Sales Outlets dataset and the CTA - Map of Fare Media Sales Outlets map, based on it, because they are no longer valid.Â  The retail sales program for fare media changed with the introduction of Ventra cards and the current locations are not yet available in dataset format.
