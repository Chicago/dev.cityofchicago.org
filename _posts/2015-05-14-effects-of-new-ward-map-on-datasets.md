On 5/18/2015, the City of Chicago will formally adopt its new ward map. This is the map, based on the 2010 Census, that was used for the recent City Council elections, with the elected aldermen’s terms in office beginning on that date.In addition to defining City Council districts, the City uses wards for many internal purposes and they appear in some datasets. The following is a list of those datasets and how they will be affected by the ward transition.All Records ConvertedIn the following datasets, all records will show the new (2015) ward.311 Service Requests datasetsBusiness LicensesCity-Owned Land Inventory (Already converted.)Crimes - 2001 to presentCrimes - One year prior to presentMicro-Market Recovery Program datasetsParking Permit Zones (”Ward - Low” and “Ward - High” will be converted. The “Sponsor Ward” column, which is ambiguous due to ward remaps and no longer used or maintained internally, will be removed altogether.)Only New RecordsIn the following dataset, existing records will retain the current (2003) ward but records added from 5/18/2015 forward will show the new (2015) ward.Roadway Construction MoratoriumsDual DatasetsAs discussed in a recent post and one earlier this year, street sweeping zones are based around wards and therefore will change on May 18. There is one map and schedule for April through May 15 and another map and schedule for May 18 through November.Converted at Next UpdateThe following datasets are updated infrequently and will retain the current (2003) ward until the next update, at which point the tentative plan is that all records will switch to the new (2015) ward.Bike RacksBuilding Code Scofflaw ListChicago Microlending Institute (CMI) MicroloansCTA - System Information - Bus Stop Shelters in Digital Sign ProjectParks - BuildingsParks - LocationsProblem Landlord ListWard Offices (Should be updated soon, after new alderman have finalized their office locations.)Youth CentersPlease note that these plans may evolve and we will update this post, as necessary.For historical reference, we will export the last or close-to-last versions of the affected datasets that use the current ward map to CSV and post all of these CSV files to a single ZIP archive on the Data Portal. We will add a link here once it is available. (6/19/2015 - Due to size, it was necessary to export to two ZIP files: Crimes - 2001 to present and All other datasets.)We will also display both ward maps on many of our Data Lens pages, which are able to assign records to both sets of wards based on a Location column, even if no Ward column is available explicitly.Updates 6/19/2015, 2:11 pm: The 311 Service Request datasets moved from “Only New Records” to “All Records Converted.”Added the links to the ZIP archives of historical dataset exports.
