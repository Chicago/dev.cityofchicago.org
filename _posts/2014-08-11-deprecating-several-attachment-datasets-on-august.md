Several map datasets which are available as “attachments” are being deprecated at the end of August. These datasets require the use of special application, such as Google Earth, ArcGIS, or QGIS, to view the maps.
These datasets are superseded by interactive maps that can be viewed within a modern web browser. In addition, users can still export these maps to KML, KMZ, or Shapefiles. These maps are already available on the portal and should be used. The deprecated datasets are being removed to reduce redundancy and clutter on the portal.
Users can find the newer maps with the tag “map_layer”.
Below is the list of datasets being retired:
Central Business District (new endpoint)
ZIP codes (new endpoint)
Census Blocks 2000 (new endpoint)
Census Blocks 2010 (new endpoint)
Census Tracts 2000 (new endpoint)
Census Tracts 2010 (new endpoint)
Enterprise Zones (new endpoint)
Any questions or concerns, feel free to contact @ChicagoCDO or dataportal@cityofchicago.org.
