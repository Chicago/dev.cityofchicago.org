Many of the automated jobs we use to update datasets are failing. This problem started at about 9 am so the bulk of our datasets that update overnight are current.  The only known exception is Speed Camera Violations, which coincidentally failed last night and cannot be rerun manually at this time.The main effect is on our datasets which update every 15 minutes (Towed Vehicles, Relocated Vehicles, Traffic Congestion by Region, and Traffic Congestion by Segment) and every hour during business hours (Public Chauffeurs).We are working with our Data Portal vendor and will post any significant updates, either as modifications to this post or new posts.We apologize for the inconvenience.Update 5:20 pm - The updates are working again.  Every dataset mentioned above, including Speed Camera Violations, has gone through at least one update since 5 pm today and appears to be updating on its normal cycle.
