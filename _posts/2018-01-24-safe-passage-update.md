We have updated the [Chicago Public Schools - Safe Passage Routes SY1718](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/4hq3-77tn) dataset. The Chicago Public Schools recently added 14 routes and removed one. Please use the Contact Dataset Owner link in the dataset for any questions.

We do not usually announce dataset updates here but it seemed worthwhile in this case since users might not have the expectation that this dataset could change after initial publication.
