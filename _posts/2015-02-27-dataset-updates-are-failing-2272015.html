<p>Many of the automated jobs we use to update datasets are failing. This problem started at about 9 am so the bulk of our datasets that update overnight are current.  The only known exception is <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/d/hhkd-xvj4">Speed Camera Violations</a>, which coincidentally failed last night and cannot be rerun manually at this time.</p><p>The main effect is on our datasets which update every 15 minutes (<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ygr5-vcbg">Towed Vehicles</a>, <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/5k2z-suxx">Relocated Vehicles</a>, <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd">Traffic Congestion by Region</a>, and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf">Traffic Congestion by Segment</a>) and every hour during business hours (<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/97wa-y6ff">Public Chauffeurs</a>).</p><p>We are working with our Data Portal vendor and will post any significant updates, either as modifications to this post or new posts.</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience.<br/></p><p><b>Update 5:20 pm - </b>The updates are working again.  Every dataset mentioned above, including Speed Camera Violations, has gone through at least one update since 5 pm today and appears to be updating on its normal cycle.</p>
