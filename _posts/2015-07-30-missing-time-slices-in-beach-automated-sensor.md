Some hourly updates for the Beach Water Quality - Automated Sensors and Beach Weather Stations - Automated Sensors datasets have been failing since yesterday. The Chicago Park District is aware of the problem and is working to fix it.Unlike some datasets, the nature of how these datasets are updated means the missing time slices will not be filled in, even after the underlying problem is fixed.
