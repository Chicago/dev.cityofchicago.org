We will be removing the Regional_Connections column (API Name: inter_modal) from CTA - System Information - Bus Stop Shelters in Digital Sign Project because that data element is no longer available from the source system.
This change will be made soon because we discovered the issue in the course of updating the dataset and do not want to hold back the fresh data longer than necessary.  We are still figuring out the exact timing – no later than next week – but did not want to delay this notice.
