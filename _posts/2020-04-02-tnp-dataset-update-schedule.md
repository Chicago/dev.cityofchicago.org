Due to issues related to COVID-19, we anticipate delays in collecting and processing the January-March 2020 source data that will be used to populate our Transportation Network Provider [datasets](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&tags=tnp&sortBy=alpha). Our current estimate is that we will be able to update the datasets by mid-May. If that changes, we will post an update here.
