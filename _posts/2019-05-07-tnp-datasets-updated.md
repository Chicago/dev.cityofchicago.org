We added to the Transportation Network Provider datasets with data reported by the companies covering January to March 2019.

We updated existing records in the datasets to reflect the following:
* [Trips](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/m6dm-c72p) dataset: Updated selected November and December `Trip Start Timestamp` and `Trip End Timestamp` values. They were previously reported in UTC instead of local Chicago time â€“ CST (UTC-6) or CDT (UTC-5), depending on date.
* [Drivers](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/j6wf-834c) and [Vehicles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/bc6b-sq4u) datasets: Added some records for the 2018-09 `MONTH_REPORTED`.
