The Towed Vehicles dataset, which normally updates every 15 minutes, has not updated since 10:01 am today.  We are investigating the cause and will post any significant changes – including when the updates resume – as edits to this post.Services making use of this dataset, such as http://www.wasmycartowed.com, will also be affected.  We are not certain but initial indications are that the City of Chicago’s Find Your Vehicle page also has not been updating for towed vehicles since approximately the same time.Please note that the Relocated Vehicles dataset updates separately and appears to be working properly.Update 8/10/2016, 12:43 pm - The dataset appears to be updating properly again.  We will continue to monitor but this will be the last update unless the problem returns.
