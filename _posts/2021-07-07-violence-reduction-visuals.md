To complement the new [violence reduction datasets](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&tags=violence+reduction) on the City of Chicago Data Portal, the Mayor's Office also launched a [violence reduction dashboard](http://www.chicago.gov/vrdashboard) featuring violence and victimization data and visualizations. It shows daily updated data and trends related to violence, victimization demographics, equity, and the City's violence reduction strategy.
 
This produced the situation of two competing versions of visuals out there for these datasets. To streamline the user experience and reduce confusion, we have decided to host all visuals for these datasets within the VR dashboard.
 
__As a result, we will be removing all visualizations based on these datasets from the Data Portal, while retaining all the underlying data within the datasets.__  For clarity, no published data are being removed. The views involved are purely visualizations of those data and, in fact, any public user can create the same views or similar ones customized to their specific needs.

As always, please feel free to contact the City of Chicago Open Data Team at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions.
