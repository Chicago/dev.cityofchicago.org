As mentioned in the previous post, every dataset on the Chicago Data Portal has a unique identifier, often known as a 4x4.  It is the string of four alphanumeric characters, a dash, and four more alphanumeric characters found at the end of the URL.  For example, in https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2, it is ijzp-q8t2.
We typically tag posts on this blog with the 4x4’s of the affected datasets.  You can quickly load the corresponding dataset at the URL https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/[4x4] – for example, https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/ijzp-q8t2.
