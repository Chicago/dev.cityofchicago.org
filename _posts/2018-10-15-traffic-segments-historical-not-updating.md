The [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Segment - 2018-Current](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x) dataset has not updated since 10/1/2018. We just became aware of the problem on 10/13/2018 and do not have an estimated fix time. We also do not know yet if the missing time slices will be recoverable or if there will be a permanent gap in the data.

We will update this post with any significant developments.
