Due to a typo when the dataset was created, the name of the “Date Received” column in the FOIA Request Log - Police dataset is misspelled as “Date Recieved” and the API Identifier is correspondingly misspelled as “date_recieved” instead of “date_received” in this dataset.On 1/11/2016, we will correct both the column name and the API 

Identifier 

 to the correct spelling, making this dataset consistent with our other FOIA Log datasets. Please make any necessary changes to processes that refer to this column.
