We have updated the [Boundaries - City](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ewy2-6yfk) geographic dataset with a slightly updated version of the City of Chicago boundary. The changes primarily relate to land acquired for O'Hare airport modernization and have been in effect for quite some time but we only recently realized they were not reflected in this dataset.

What we believe to be the most recent previous version of the City boundary is in [Boundaries - City - Outdated Format](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/q38j-zgre).
