<p>We are having a technical error updating the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ydr8-5enu">Building Permits</a> dataset. Â The data last updated Sunday morning, although little or no new data is generated over a weekend so today is the first day the dataset is behind in any significant way.</p><p>We are working on tracking down and solving the problem and will post any substantial updates as edits to this post &ndash; including when the dataset updates have resumed.</p><p><b>Update 3/30/2017 - </b>The dataset has been updating properly since 3/23/2017.</p>
