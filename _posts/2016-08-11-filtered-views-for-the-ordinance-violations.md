We recently released a dataset of ordinance violations related to the Department of Buildings.  However, we will be adding violations from other departments so it is not advisable to use links to the full dataset for purposes that relate only to that department.We have created a filtered view specifically for Department of Buildings violations.  That view can be treated like a dataset for most purposes and will always stay in sync with the full dataset.  We will be creating similar filtered views for other departments, as we add them. You can find the filtered views for any dataset – as well as other manipulations and presentations of the data – by clicking the purple “More Views” button at the upper-right of the page
