The [311 Service Requests - Alley Lights Out](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t28b-ys7j) dataset has not updated since 12/23/2017 due to a technical issue. We are investigating and attempting to fix the problem. The other 11 datasets in the [311 Service Requests](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?category=Service+Requests&limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha) series are updating properly.
