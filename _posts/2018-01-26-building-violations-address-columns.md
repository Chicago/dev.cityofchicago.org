We have modified the [Building Violations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/22u3-xenr) dataset to add separate columns for each component of the building address:

* STREET NUMBER
* STREET DIRECTION
* STREET NAME
* STREET TYPE

The ADDRESS column containing the entire street address in one column is still present and will remain.
