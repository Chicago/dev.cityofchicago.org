Due to data processing errors, some Transportation Network Provider trips in the first nine months of 2019 were not reported to the City of Chicago and therefore not initially included in the [Transportation Network Providers - Trips](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/m6dm-c72p) dataset. The errors have now been corrected. We have received the trips and added them to the dataset. The net increases per month are:

|Month|Previous Total|Added Trips|Added Trips %|
|-----|--------------|-----------|-------------|
|1/2019|8,784,478|505|0.0%|
|2/2019|8,849,200|115|0.0%|
|3/2019|10,268,356|787|0.0%|
|4/2019|9,110,255|101,556|1.1%|
|5/2019|9,570,820|136,071|1.4%|
|6/2019|9,229,938|288,855|3.1%|
|7/2019|9,138,818|2|0.0%
|8/2019|9,407,139|0|0.0%|
|9/2019|8,916,392|10|0.0%|

In total we have added 527,901 trips. The previous total for these nine months was 83,275,396 trips, so we have added 0.6%, overall. The missing trips just added occurred primarily in the months of April-June 2019.

Given that the published dataset does not contain the name of the company that provided each trip, there is no company name associated with the updated records.
