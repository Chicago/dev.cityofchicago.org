Due to an issue with the source data over the weekend, the [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf) and [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Regions](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd) datasets did not update between 1/11/2019 10:50 pm and 1/14/2019 12:10 pm (today).

The corresponding historical datasets also did not update. We will not be able to recover the missing time period so there will be a permanent gap in the data:

* [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Segment - 2018-Current](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x)
* [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Region - 2018-Current](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/kf7e-cur8)
