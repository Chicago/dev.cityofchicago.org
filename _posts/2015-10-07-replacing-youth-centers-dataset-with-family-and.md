We have published a Family and Support Services Delegate Agencies dataset, which is a list of the delegate agencies with which the Department of Family and Support Services has contracted to provide services to residents of Chicago.  This dataset replaces the Youth Centers dataset.  It includes both more rows (all delegate agency types) and more columns of data about each agency.We will deprecate the Youth Centers dataset on or after 11/2/2015.  Please update any links and API endpoints before that date.
