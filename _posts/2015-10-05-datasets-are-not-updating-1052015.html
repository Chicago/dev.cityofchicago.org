<p>Due to a planned outage yesterday and an unexpected server issue this morning, none of our automated dataset updates have run yet today and some datasets were last updated Saturday. Â Datasets that reflect routine, business-hours City activities should still be largely up-to-date because few records are created or changed in the underlying systems over a weekend.</p><p><b>Update 10/6/2015 - The problems were resolved yesterday and all datasets updated this morning.</b></p>
