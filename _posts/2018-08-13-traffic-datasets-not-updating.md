Due to an issue with the source data, the [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf) and [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Regions](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd) datasets have not updated since Saturday, 8/11/2018 9:31 am.

We are looking into the problem and will update this post with any significant developments.
