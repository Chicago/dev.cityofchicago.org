Due to an issue with the source data, the [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf) and [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Regions](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd) datasets have not updated since Saturday, 8/11/2018 9:31 am.

The corresponding historical datasets also are not updating. While we are not certain yet, most likely we will not be able to recover the missing time period and there will be a permanent gap in the data:

* [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Segment - 2018-Current](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sxs8-h27x)
* [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Region - 2018-Current](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/kf7e-cur8)

We are looking into the problem and will update this post with any significant developments.

**Update 8/14/2018, 10:25 am:** All of these datasets are updating again, although, as expected, there are gaps in the historical datasets that will be permanent. Please note that there is a set of readings at approximately 11:30 pm last night (8/31/2018) but that there is otherwise a gap from approximately 8/11/2018 9:30 am to 8/14/2018 9:20 am.
