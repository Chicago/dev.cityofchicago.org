The [Taxi Trips](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/wrvz-psew) dataset has not been updated since the July trips due to an issue with the source data. We are working on the problem but do not have an estimated resolution date.

It is possible that once we fully understand and solve the problem, data from past months will be updated.

**Update, 7/1/2019:** Please see this [post](http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2019/07/01/taxi-dataset-relaunch.html) for the resolution of this issue.
