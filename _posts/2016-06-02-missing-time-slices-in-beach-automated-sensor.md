The hourly updates for the Beach Water Quality - Automated Sensors and Beach Weather Stations - Automated Sensors datasets have been failing since 5 am. We are investigating the problem.Unlike some datasets, the nature of how these datasets are updated means the missing time slices will not be filled in, even after the underlying problem is fixed.Update 6/2/2016, 2:10 pm - The problem has been fixed and the datasets are updating.
