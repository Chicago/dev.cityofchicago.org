Knowing how easy it can be for data portal administrators to miss a very useful enhancement -- as we initially did in this case -- we wanted to highlight a change [Socrata](https://socrata.com/) recently made. It is now possible to update some dataset column properties without creating a [working copy](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/202949958-Editing-datasets-using-a-working-copy) and publishing again. 



The [Red Light Camera Violations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/spqx-js37) dataset is not updating due to a technical issue. We are investigating and attempting to fix the problem.

**Update 6/12/2017, 3 pm -** We have solved the problem. The dataset is current and we expect future update jobs to run correctly.
