The [Relocated Vehicles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/5k2z-suxx) dataset is not updating. We are investigating the cause and a potential solution. In the meantime, we will do occasional manual updates but cannot maintain anything close to the normal 15-minute, automated update frequency.

As a reminder, the City of Chicago also maintains a [Vehicle Search](https://webapps1.chicago.gov/vehicleSearch/) site. It is unaffected by the current issue.

We will edit this post with any significant updates and when the problem has been resolved.

**Update 8/9/2019, 3:15 pm:** We have solved the problem and the dataset is updating on schedule again.
