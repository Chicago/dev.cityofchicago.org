We have modified the [Payments](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/s4vu-giwb) dataset to add a `CASHED` column, indicating whether the payment check has been cashed yet.

As a side effect, the number of rows has changed. Certain payments to the same vendor have always been combined in this dataset and that continues to be the case. The exact number of records has changed but the totals, including totals per vendor per date should remain the same.

As always, please contact the City of Chicago Open Data Team at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions related to using the Data Portal. However, please direct any subject matter questions about the payments to [payments@cityofchicago.org](mailto:payments@cityofchicago.org).
