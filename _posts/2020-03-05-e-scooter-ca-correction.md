We recently discovered that, due to a technical bug, the `Start Community Area Number` and `End Community Area Number` values in the recently released [E-Scooter Trips - 2019 Pilot](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/2kfw-zvte) dataset were incorrect. We apologize for the error and have corrected it.

The `Start Community Area Name` and `End Community Area Name` columns (as well as all other columns in the dataset) were not affected and are unchanged.

This issue was initially caught by a public user of the dataset who e-mailed us. We very much appreciate this sort of help from the community and encourage you to continue to contact us at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions, comments, or concerns.
