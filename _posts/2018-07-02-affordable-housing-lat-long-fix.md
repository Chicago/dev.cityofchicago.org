We discovered today that the Latitude and Longitude columns in the Affordable Rental Housing Developments [dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/s6ha-ppgi) were flipped, due to an error during the last update in April 2018. This also affected the Location column. We have fixed the error.

Thank you to the member of the public who e-mailed us at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) to point out this error.
