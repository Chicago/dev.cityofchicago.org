With the [Smart Green Infrastructure Monitoring](https://www.uilabs.org/press/new-cloud-based-platform-addresses-urban-flooding-through-green-infrastructure-performance-monitoring) pilot project coming to an end, we have turned off updates for the [dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ggws-77ih) that published the sensor observations on a near-real-time basis.  This dataset contains almost 14 months of data and will remain on the Chicago Data Portal for historical reference.
