We are making two changes to the [City-Owned Land Inventory](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/aksk-kvfp) dataset.

1.  We have added the column `Managing Organization`. In addition to the direct meaning, this column can also be used to identify properties that *may* be for sale. These will be the properties where the `Managing Organization` is "None" or blank. To find out for sure or for any other questions related to City land sales, please e-mail [landsales@cityofchicago.org](mailto:landsales@cityofchicago.org).
2. No sooner than 8/14/2020, we will be removing the `Legal Description` column. It is not maintained internally and is not considered reliable. Notwithstanding that warning, we wanted to give advance notice for anyone who might wish to download a copy of the current values. We will also create a "Dataset Snapshot" under "View Data" / "More Views" as a historical record, although cannot guarantee how long it will be retained so similarly recommend downloading a copy if you will want the data long-term.

As always, please contact the City of Chicago Open Data Team at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions.
