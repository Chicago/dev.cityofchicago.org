Starting with todayâ€™s (2/8/2021) update, COVID-19 case and test datasets will include antigen tests in addition to the molecular (PCR) tests that have been reported until now. Both [antigen and PCR tests](https://www.fda.gov/health-professionals/closer-look-covid-19-diagnostic-testing) are used to determine if a person has an active infection, meaning they have COVID-19 infection at the time they are tested. This change has been made because the use of antigen tests has increased over time. **This change will affect historical daily or weekly counts from the addition of antigen positive cases and antigen tests.** Datasets that will see past values increase because of this change are: 

* [COVID-19 Daily Cases, Deaths, and Hospitalizations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Cases-Deaths-and-Hospitalizations/naz8-j4nc)
* [COVID-19 Daily Rolling Average Case, Death, and Hospitalization Rates](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Rolling-Average-Case-Death-and-Hosp/e68t-c7fv)
* [COVID-19 Cases, Tests, and Deaths by ZIP Code](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Cases-Tests-and-Deaths-by-ZIP-Code/yhhz-zm2v)
* [COVID-19 Daily Testing - By Test](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Testing-By-Test/gkdw-2tgv)
* [COVID-19 Daily Testing - By Person](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Testing-By-Person/t4hh-4ku9)

Nothing structural about the datasets will change. No columns will be added, removed, or otherwise changed.
