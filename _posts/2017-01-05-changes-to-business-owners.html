<p>We have made two changes to the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ezma-pppn">Business Owners</a> dataset:</p><ul><li>Records now go back to 2002 (previously 2006) for compatibility with the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/r5kz-chrr/">Business Licenses</a> dataset.</li><li>We changed the source for the Legal Name column so that it more accurately displays the legal name. Â Previously, it sometimes displayed a related name for the business.</li></ul><p>Before these changes, the legal name issue created some unintended duplication of otherwise-identical records. Therefore, the fix reduces the number of records but that reduction happens to be approximately offset by adding four years of data so the end result is only a small change in record count.</p>
