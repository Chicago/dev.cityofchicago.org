No sooner than August 10, 2020, we will be removing the [Housing and Economic Development Payment Receipts](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/w7c3-qjgj) dataset. This dataset was based on a step in the payment process that is no longer used and therefore no longer produced data for this dataset.

All of the payments that previously were or would have been shown in this dataset under the retired process should appear in the [Payments](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/s4vu-giwb) dataset once processed.

As always, please contact the City of Chicago Open Data Team at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions.
