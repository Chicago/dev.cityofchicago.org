We have updated the Restricted
Flavored Tobacco Product dataset. The updates reflect the
amended rule for enforcement of restrictions on the sale of flavored
tobacco products within 500 feet of schools, effective December 14, 2015. The new dataset includes hundreds of additional
flavored tobacco products identified by the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH). In addition we have made the following changes to the dataset structure:Added a DETAIL column providing more information
about tobacco product flavors. For example, there may be a product where FLAVOR is BLUE
MAGIC and DETAIL is BLUEBERRY.Removed the UPC column to simplify the
search process.Removed the EFFECTIVE DATE column to reflect the new rules,
which no longer require a product be included on the list to be banned.Previously, this dataset would have been updated quarterly.
Moving forward it will be updated periodically with new products at the
discretion of CDPH.For any questions about the content of the dataset, please contact CDPH at flavoredtobacco@cityofchicago.org.
