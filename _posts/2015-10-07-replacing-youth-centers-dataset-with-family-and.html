<p>We have published a <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/jmw7-ijg5">Family and Support Services Delegate Agencies</a> dataset, which is a list of the delegate agencies with which the Department of Family and Support Services has contracted to provide services to residents of Chicago.  This dataset replaces the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/meks-hp6f">Youth Centers</a> dataset.  It includes both more rows (all delegate agency types) and more columns of data about each agency.</p><p>We will deprecate the Youth Centers dataset on or after 11/2/2015.  Please update any links and API endpoints before that date.</p>
