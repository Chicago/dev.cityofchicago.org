<p>We have removed the shapefile (2wak-k8cp) and KML (kmdg-2wwn) versions of the current Bike Route <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/3w5d-sru8">dataset</a>, which is in our newer, interactive format.  This is just a housekeeping action since the new dataset has been on the Data Portal for quite a while, contains the same version of the map, and allows for exporting both the shapefile and KML formats.</p>
