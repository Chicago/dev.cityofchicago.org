If you want only Chicago locations, please use the newÂ <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/fi3z-jc3f">Alternative Fuel Locations - Chicago</a> filtered view.</p><p>We have also enhanced the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/iq3c-68ew">Alternative Fuel Locations map</a> to color-code the type of alternative fuel at each location.</p>
