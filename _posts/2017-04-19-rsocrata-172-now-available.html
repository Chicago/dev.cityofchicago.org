<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSocrata/index.html">RSocrata</a> 1.7.2 is now available on CRAN. This release contains a number of bug fixes and performance improvements. The core development team has also changed a policy to support the most recent version of R.

<h3>Performance improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>By default, 1000 rows at a time were being retreived for each API call while paging through data. Increased to retreive 50,000 rows for each API call. ([#129](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/129))</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug which caused an error if a ```select=count()``` statement was present in a URL. (<a href="https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/120">#120</a>)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug when data types are not found because there are no ```X-SODA2-*``` headers available in the API response. Users will now get a warning and data will be returned as ```character```. (<a href="https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/118">#118</a>)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug which did not recognize URLs listed from ```ls.socrata()``` as valid URLs to be used in ```read.socrata()```. Users will now be able to use URLs from the former function in the latter function. (<a href="https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/124">#124</a>)</li>
  <li>Removed unit tests for older releases of R. (<a href="https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/136">#136</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deprecation</h3>

<p>RSocrata's core development team has stated a formal policy to only support the most recent release of R. Until now, RSocrata was tested against the penultimate release of R; however, testing will be limited to the current version of R and the current development release. The project's <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing guidelines</a> have been updated to reflect that accepted changes to RSocrata must pass tests on the current and penulimate versions of R.</p>

<p>While RSocrata is only tested on the current and penultimate version, the core development team expects it will work on older versions most of the time. See <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/132">#132</a> for more information.</p>
