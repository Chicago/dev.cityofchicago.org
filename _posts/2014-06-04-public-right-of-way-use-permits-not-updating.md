The public right-of-way use permits dataset has not successfully updated since May 28. This is an automated dataset and has not succeeded due to hitting a file size limit. We know the solution and plan to implement it as soon as possible. In the meantime, we plan to do manual updates on business days, although may not be able to begin until tomorrow.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
Update 6/5/2014Â - The dataset is current again and expected to update successfully daily.
