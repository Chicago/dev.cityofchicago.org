With today's update of the [Chicago Energy Benchmarking - Covered Buildings](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/g5i5-yz37) dataset, we have renamed one column and added another:

* **Required Year** (previously, simply **Year**) - The year the building is next required to report data. This is generally every year. Note that the API field name has changed correspondingly from **year** to **required_year**.
* **Verification Year** - The year the building next must verify data accuracy. This is generally every three years.
