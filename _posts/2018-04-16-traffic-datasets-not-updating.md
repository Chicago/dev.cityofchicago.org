The real-time traffic datasets are not updating, due to a technical problem. These datasets are:

* [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/n4j6-wkkf)
* [Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Regions](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t2qc-9pjd)

The historical datasets that accumulate records over time may or may not end up missing the records for the time period of this outage. We are not sure yet.

We are investigating the problem and will update this post with any significant updates.
