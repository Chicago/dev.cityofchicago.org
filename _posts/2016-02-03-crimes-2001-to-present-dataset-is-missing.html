<p>Due to an error in this morning’s update job, most records in the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ijzp-q8t2">Crimes - 2001 to present</a> dataset were deleted, leaving only 722 records. We are working on the problem and hope to have a complete dataset by tomorrow morning.</p><p>In the meantime, the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/x2n5-8w5q">Crimes - One year prior to present</a> dataset, which shows a trailing year of records, appears to be accurate and can be used as an alternate source for that time period.</p>
