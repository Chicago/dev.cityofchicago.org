Starting today (6/10/2021), COVID-19 case, test, and vaccination datasets will only be updated Monday through Friday, excluding  [City holidays](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/narr/misc/city-holidays.html). This is a change from the past when they were updated daily, including weekends and holidays. 

As a result of this change, the [COVID Daily Dashboard](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/covid-dashboard.html) will also only be refreshed Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

In both cases, data records for all seven days of the week will continue to be reported in the dataset -- just delayed for data that previously would have been posted over the weekend or on a holiday.

The affected datasets are the following.

* [COVID-19 Daily Rolling Average Case, Death, and Hospitalization Rates](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/e68t-c7fv)
* [COVID-19 Daily Testing - By Test](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/gkdw-2tgv)
* [COVID-19 Vaccinations by ZIP Code](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/553k-3xzc)
* [COVID-19 Daily Vaccinations - Chicago Residents](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/2vhs-cf6b)
* [COVID-19 Daily Vaccinations - Administered in Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/4564-ixr2)

Nothing structural about the datasets will change. No columns will be added, removed, or otherwise changed.
