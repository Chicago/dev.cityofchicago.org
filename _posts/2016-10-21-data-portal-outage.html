<p>Because of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage/">ongoing, widespread internet outage</a>, the City of Chicago data portal is unavailable. This impacts both visitors to the webpage itself and those using the API.</p><p>We fully expect the portal will be available as the internet outage is resolved.</p>
