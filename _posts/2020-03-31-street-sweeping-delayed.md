Users of the [Street Sweeping Schedule - 2020](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/bbt9-ihrm) dataset, please note that the Department of Streets and Sanitation has made the following [announcement](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/streets/provdrs/streets_san/svcs/street_sweeping2020.html):

> The start of the Residential Street Sweeping Program, originally scheduled for April 1st is currently delayed.  The Department of Streets & Sanitation will continue to sweep main and arterial streets.  Check back for updates on this page.

The dataset will not be updated to reflect this delay. Please refer to the above linked page to know if and when street sweeping returns to the published schedule.

We *have* made some updates to the dataset to correct typos. Further corrections are always possible so we recommend using the then-current dataset for the most up-to-date schedule once the delay is lifted.
