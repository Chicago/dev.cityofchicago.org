<p>We have updated the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/5wce-bks2">Restricted
Flavored Tobacco Product</a> dataset. The updates reflect <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dol/rulesandregs/FlavoredTobaccoRulesAmended122015.pdf">the
amended rule</a> for enforcement of restrictions on the sale of flavored
tobacco products within 500 feet of schools, effective December 14, 2015. </p><p>The new dataset includes hundreds of additional
flavored tobacco products identified by the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH). </p><p>In addition we have made the following changes to the dataset structure:</p><ul><li>Added a DETAIL column providing more information
about tobacco product flavors. For example, there may be a product where FLAVOR is BLUE
MAGIC and DETAIL is BLUEBERRY.</li><li>Removed the UPC column to simplify the
search process.</li><li>Removed the EFFECTIVE DATE column to reflect the new rules,
which no longer require a product be included on the list to be banned.<br/></li></ul><p>Previously, this dataset would have been updated quarterly.
Moving forward it will be updated periodically with new products at the
discretion of CDPH.</p><p>For any questions about the content of the dataset, please contact CDPH at flavoredtobacco@cityofchicago.org.</p>
