<p>The hourly updates for the<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku"> Beach Water Quality - Automated Sensors</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75">Beach Weather Stations - Automated Sensors</a> datasets have been failing since 5 am. We are investigating the problem.</p><p>Unlike some datasets, the nature of how these datasets are updated means the missing time slices will not be filled in, even after the underlying problem is fixed.</p><p><b>Update 6/2/2016, 2:10 pm - The problem has been fixed and the datasets are updating.</b></p>
