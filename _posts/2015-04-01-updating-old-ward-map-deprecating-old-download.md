We will be removing the standalone ward maps for 2013-2015 that exist in the Shapefile and KML format. You will be able to access and download the 2013-2015 ward map at its new location. The new location has on-screen map navigation and is also downloadable.Â The deprecated versions will be removed no earlier than April 30th.
