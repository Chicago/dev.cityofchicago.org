<p>We have posted our <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/waad-z968">street sweeping schedule</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/4qtf-5nmn">map</a>, for sweeping and associated parking restrictions that begin on April 1.  These datasets go only through Friday, May 15 because Chicago’s new ward map will go into effect on May 18, affecting a range of City operations, including street sweeping.  We will post revised or supplemental datasets to cover the remainder of the street sweeping season, through November.</p>
