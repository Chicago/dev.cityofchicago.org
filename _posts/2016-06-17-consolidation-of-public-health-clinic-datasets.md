The Chicago Department of Public Health has historically published three datasets showing the locations, hours, and other information about different clinic types it operates.  Those datasets have been consolidated into a single dataset, with associated map.Please update any references to the old datasets and maps:Mental Health Clinics: Dataset / MapSTI Speciality Clinics: Dataset / Map

Women, Infant, Children Health Clinics: Dataset / Map
These old datasets and maps will be removed on or after 7/15/2016.
