With today's update of the [Chicago Energy Benchmarking - Covered Buildings](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/g5i5-yz37) dataset, we have removed one column and added another:

* Removed: `Year` - The year the building is next required to report data. This is the current year for almost every building and the difficultly  of posting the few one-year extensions reliably meant this column was more misleading than helpful.
* Added: `Verification Year` - The year the building next must verify data accuracy. This is generally every three years.
