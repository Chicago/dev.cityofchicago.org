We have reloaded the [2019 Data Reported in 2020](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/jn94-it7m) data in the [Chicago Energy Benchmarking](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c) dataset due to errors discovered in the original data.

Partly to facilitate the update process and partly because it may be useful for other purposes, we have added a `Row_ID` column to the dataset. It is simply the combination of the `Data Year` and `ID` (property ID) columns. Within any year, the `ID` column alone should be unique.

As always, please feel free to contact us at [dataportal@cityofchicago.org](mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org) or [@ChicagoCDO](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) with any questions, comments, or concerns related to the datasets. For subject matter questions about the Energy Benchmarking datasets please contact that [program](http://www.chicago.gov/EnergyBenchmarking) at [Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org](mailto:Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org). This correction was prompted by an e-mail from a public user of the dataset. We very much appreciate such messages.
